                <h3>Green Roofs and Living Walls</h3>
                <b>Green roofs</b>, also known as vegetated roofs or eco-roofs, are roof surfaces covered in vegetation planted over a waterproof membrane.  
                These systems usually have several layers, including a root barrier, a drainage layer, and soil or growing medium.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Living walls</b>, also known as vertical gardens or green walls, are structures covered in plants that can be attached directly to the wall or installed using modular systems.
                These walls can be built indoors or outdoors and are intended to support a wide range of plant species, including flowers, ferns, and even edible plants.

                <h2>Types of Green Roofs:</h2>
                <p>Understanding the distinct types of green roofs is key to selecting the ideal solution for your home. Below is an overview of the main categories and their unique features.</p>
                <h3>Extensive Green Roofs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b>Shallow growing medium (2–6 inches), supporting hardy, low-maintenance plants like sedums, mosses, and grasses.</li>
                    <li><b>Applications:</b> Suitable for residential and commercial buildings due to their lightweight nature, requiring minimal structural modifications.</li>
                    <li><b>Benefits</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enhances stormwater management.</li>
                            <li>Provides insulation for buildings.</li>
                            <li>Promotes urban biodiversity.</li>
                            <li>Low-maintenance, needing little irrigation or occasional upkeep.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Intensive Green Roofs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Deeper growing medium (8–24 inches or more), allowing for a diverse range of plants, including flowers, shrubs, and small trees.</li>
                    <li><b>Applications:</b> Often designed as rooftop gardens featuring walkways, seating areas, and water features, creating functional and visually appealing outdoor spaces.</li>
                    <li><b>Benefits</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides recreational spaces for building occupants.</li>
                            <li>Supports urban agriculture and gardening opportunities.</li>
                            <li>Enhances aesthetics and increases property value.</li>
                            <li>Improves thermal insulation and reduces energy consumption.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Considerations:</b> Requires higher structural support, increased installation costs, and regular maintenance due to its complexity and weight.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Semi-Intensive Green Roofs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Medium-depth growing medium (4–8 inches), bridging the gap between extensive and intensive systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Applications:</b> Offers flexibility in design, accommodating a mix of aesthetic and practical needs for urban spaces.</li>
                    <li><b>Benefits</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Balances ecological and design goals with moderate complexity.</li>
                            <li>Provides effective stormwater management and thermal insulation.</li>
                            <li>Encourages biodiversity while requiring less structural support than intensive systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Maintenance:</b> Generally moderate, involving periodic care for plants and substrate.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Key Advantages of Green Roofs and Living Walls</h2>
                <h3>Improved Air Quality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plants on green roofs and living walls filter air by absorbing pollutants and CO2.</li>
                    <li>Oxygen released through photosynthesis contributes to cleaner, healthier air—particularly in polluted urban areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reduced Energy Costs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Green roofs and living walls act as natural insulators, regulating building temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Decreases reliance on air conditioning in summer and heating in winter, leading to energy savings.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Enhanced Biodiversity</h3>
                <ul>
