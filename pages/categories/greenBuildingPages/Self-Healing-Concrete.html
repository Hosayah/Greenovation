                <h3>Self-Healing Concrete</h3>
                The ability of concrete to heal minimizes the requirement for fracture detection and repair, which would otherwise lead to reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration.  
                This lowers expenses while increasing durability.  <br><br>
                <b>Self-healing concretes</b> lessen the requirement to discover and fix cracks and are one method for mitigating corrosion risk.  
                This has social, economic, and environmental benefits since it decreases the need for maintenance and/or increases longevity, which reduces disruption, expense, and material consumption

                <h2>Efficiency of Self-Healing in Cementitious Structures</h2>
                <p>Self-healing holds great potential for improving the durability and functionality of cement-based structures, with water being a key element in facilitating the process. Research highlights several notable insights and mechanisms involved:</p>
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Studies demonstrate that <b>Bacillus pasteurii</b> enables cracked concrete to regain up to <b>90% of its original strength.</b></li>
                    <li>Victor Li from Michigan University observed that healed concrete behaves nearly like new when reloaded, exhibiting similar strength and stiffness.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Natural Self-Healing Mechanisms</h3>
                <p>Concrete can self-heal through several processes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Calcium Carbonate or Calcium Hydroxide Precipitation:</b> These are the most effective methods for autogenous healing of concrete cracks.</li>
                    <li><b>Crack Blocking by Impurities:</b> Water-borne impurities naturally fill the cracks, aiding the healing process.</li>
                    <li><b>Continued Hydration:</b> Unreacted cement or additive materials hydrate over time, filling and sealing cracks.</li>
                    <li><b>C–S–H Swelling:</b> The expansion of hydrated products around the crack flanks (e.g., calcium-silicate-hydrate) helps close the gaps.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Freeze–Thaw Cycles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Self-healing effects:</b> During freeze–thaw cycles, self-healing significantly enhances durability.</li>
                    <li><b>Complete recovery:</b> In water-based freeze–thaw cycles, concrete beams can regain their resonant frequency fully.</li>
                    <li><b>Rest periods:</b> Allowing a 30-day rest between freeze–thaw cycles accelerates the healing process and boosts frost resistance.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydration effects:</b> Continued hydration during freeze–thaw cycles contributes to slight improvements in performance, particularly in soil–cement specimens.</li>
                    <li><b>Strain-dependent healing:</b> Self-healing capacity decreases with greater pre-loaded strain levels in pre-cracked composites subjected to freeze–thaw cycles.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Material and Structural Behavior</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hydration and self-healing processes slightly improved performance during freeze–thaw tests in soil-cement specimens.</li>
                    <li>Pre-cracked cementitious composites displayed strain-hardening behavior during freeze–thaw cycles. However, higher pre-load strain levels were associated with reduced self-healing capacity.</li>
                </ul>
