                <h3>Smart Energy Management Systems</h3>
                Domestic <b>smart energy management systems</b> have been a reality for some time now, and they have been adopted by both enterprises <b>(Building Energy Management Systems)</b> and houses <b>(Home Energy Management Systems).</b>
                <br><br>These systems not only save you money on your energy bills, but they also make your life more efficient by combining all of the controls.  
                Imagine when you leave your home to pop to the shop, with one click of a button, the TV and all your lighting switches turn off and the garage door starts opening as you approach it.
