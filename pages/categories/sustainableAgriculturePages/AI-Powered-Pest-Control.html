                <h3>AI-Powered Pest Control</h3>
                <b>AI-powered pest control</b> is a novel strategy that uses AI to detect, identify, and control pests in agricultural fields.  
                <br><br>
                This technology analyzes data from a variety of sources, including drones, satellites, and field sensors, using machine learning algorithms and image recognition techniques.  
                <br><br>
                These AI algorithms are trained to identify various pests by examining hundreds of photos.  Once a bug is discovered, the system can identify the best way to destroy it.
