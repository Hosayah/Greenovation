                <h3>Lab-Grown Meat</h3>
                Lab-grown meat, also known as <b>cultivated or cultured meat</b>, is genuine meat that is grown directly from animal cells; these products are "real meat, made without the need to raise and slaughter animals."  
                <br><br>
                Cultivated beef may sound like a thing of the future, but it's closer to being available on supermarket shelves than you think.  
                <br><br>
                In reality, the first slice of lab-grown beef made headlines in 2013 when a team at the University of Maastricht revealed the first hamburger made from bovine stem cells

                <h2>What’s Remarkable About Cultivated Meat?</h2>
                <h3>Ethical Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides meat without slaughtering animals by growing it from animal cells.</li>
                    <li>ources for cells include fertilized chicken eggs, animal biopsies, and feathers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, driving climate change.</li>
                    <li>Cultivated meat reduces the need for land and water resources compared to traditional farming methods.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Global Food Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scaled production of cultivated meat could help feed the growing world population.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How Cultivated Meat Is Made</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Industrial Cell Culture:</b> Similar to fermentation in brewing beer, but uses animal cells.</li>
                    <li><b>Cell Selection:</b> Cells are taken from high-quality livestock, such as cows or chickens, for their ability to multiply and develop into meat.</li>
                    <li><b>Controlled Growth Environment:</b> Cells are placed in sterile conditions and provided with essential nutrients to replicate and mature naturally.</li>
                    <li><b>Processing and Preparation:</b> Once matured, the meat is harvested, processed like conventional products, and prepared for consumption.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Potential Health Advantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhanced nutrition profiles through technology modifying amino acids, fats, vitamins, and minerals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Vegan Considerations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cultivated meat is not vegan as it originates from animal cells and involves animal by-products.</li>
                </ul>
