                <h3>Anaerobic Digestion</h3>
                Anaerobic digestion is the process by which microorganisms degrade organic matter—such as animal manure, wastewater biosolids, and food waste—in the absence of oxygen.  Anaerobic digestion for biogas production takes place in a sealed tank known as a reactor, which is designed and built in a variety of forms and sizes depending on the site and feedstock circumstances.  These reactors contain complex microbial communities that break down (or digest) waste, producing biogas and digestate (the AD process's solid and liquid end-products), which are discharged from the digester <a href="https://www.epa.gov/agstar/how-does-anaerobic-digestion-work">(US EPA, 2024)</a>.

                <h2>Anaerobic Digestion Process</h2>
                <p>Anaerobic digestion treats domestic and industrial wastewater by breaking down organic waste. Its primary goal is to reduce waste volume, with methane as a useful by-product. Methane from landfills is also produced via anaerobic digestion of organics in low-oxygen conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Steps:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Organic Composition:</b> Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) in organics serve as substrates for microbial growth. Water (H2O) is also involved in the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Microbial Breakdown:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Initial Conversion:</b> Microorganisms break organics into substances for further processing.</li>
                            <li><b>Acid Formation:</b> Other microorganisms convert these substances into organic acids.</li>
                            <li><b>Methane Production:</b> Methanogenic bacteria transform organic acids into m
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Gas Composition:</b> The methane-to-carbon dioxide (CO2) ratio depends on the substrate. Sugars and cellulose yield equal methane and CO2, while fats and proteins produce more methane.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Methane Yield:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up to 70% methane when fats are digested.</li>
                    <li>Slaughterhouse waste produces around 60% methane.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Temperature Impact:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mesophilic Bacteria (20–45 °C):</b>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <li>Optimal range: 30–38 °C (86–100 °F).</li>
                            <li>Commonly used in anaerobic digestion.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Thermophilic Bacteria (49–57 °C):</b>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <li>Commonly used in anaerobic digestion.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
