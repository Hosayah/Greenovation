                <h3>Plastic to Fuel</h3>
                The plastic-to-fuel conversion method, also known as pyrolysis technology, can convert plastic waste into fuel oil and carbon black without polluting. <br>
                <br><b>Pyrolysis</b> oil from plastic is frequently used as fuel oil in sectors such as steel and iron, boiler factories, ceramics, power or chemical industries, and generators for electricity generation <a href="https://plasticpyrolysisplants.com/plastic-to-fuel-technology/">(Plasticpyrolysis Plant, 2019)</a>. As a result, several researchers have investigated the production of alternative liquid fuels from a range of sources, including plants, organic matter, and waste materials. Plastic, which is initially made from crude oil, may be converted into synthetic oil and gas using a process known as pyrolysis

                            <li>Plastic is shredded into smaller pieces to improve processing efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Pre-treatment steps like washing or drying remove contaminants such as dirt and moisture.</li>

                            <li>Shredded plastic is heated to 300°–500°C (572°–932°F) in an oxygen-free environment.</li>
                            <li>Thermal decomposition breaks the plastic into hydrocarbon molecules.</li>

                <h2>Advantages of Converting Plastic Waste into Fuel</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Environmental Benefits:</b> Fuels produced through this process are cleaner, emitting a lower carbon footprint compared to coal, oil, or natural gas.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduced Carbon Demand:</b> Utilizes existing carbon and hydrogen molecules, reducing the need for new carbon production.</li>
                    <li><b>Less Incineration:</b> Decreases the amount of plastic incinerated, lowering carbon emissions from the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Landfill Diversion:</b> Prevents non-recyclable plastics from ending up in landfills and reduces plastic waste exports.</li>
                    <li><b>Broader Applications:</b> Can potentially process other waste materials, such as metals, that are not easily recyclable.</li>
                    <li><b>Versatile Chemical Use:</b> Produces compounds that replace fossil fuel-based alternatives in production lines.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost Efficiency:</b> Features relatively low operational expenses once the plant is established.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduced Methane Pollution:</b> Limits methane emissions and hydrocarbon losses associated with oil and gas production.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This emerging technology represents a promising step toward sustainability, addressing both environmental and economic challenges.</p>
