                <h3>Greywater Recycling Systems</h3>
                <b>Greywater differs from blackwater</b> (toilet wastewater) in that it contains no human waste, making it easier to treat and reuse.  
                <br><br>
                This water often accounts for 50-80% of a household's wastewater and is frequently discarded as waste when it may be used productively

                <br><br>
                Greywater is a source of water in the same way as groundwater from wells and surface water from reservoirs are.   Greywater originates from within buildings.   
                Almost all of it originates from showers and laundries. Additional but lesser amounts come from bathroom sinks (lavatories) as well as drinking fountain and ice machine drainage.

                <h2>Why Use Greywater Recycling Systems?</h2>
                <h3>The Need for Greywater Recycling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growing water demand is depleting aquifers and surface water supplies.</li>
                    <li>Aging water and wastewater infrastructure struggles with increased loads.</li>
                    <li>Greywater recycling reduces dependence on municipal water sources and eases pressure on large-scale wastewater treatment plants.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Benefits of Greywater Recycling:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Water Conservation:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduces household water demand by over 40%.</li>
                            <li>Combined with rainwater collection, it can eliminate the need for municipal or well water in many regions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Energy Recovery Opportunities:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Warm greywater can preheat incoming freshwater through heat exchangers.</li>
                            <li>Warm treated greywater can be utilized for laundry, reducing energy consumption.</li>
                            <li>Energy required to treat greywater is minimal, ranging from 1.5 to 4 kWh per 1,000 gallons.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cost Savings:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Significant savings on water bills by reducing municipal water use.</li>
                            <li>Commercial greywater systems offer high ROI, especially in water-stressed cities like Atlanta, Seattle, and San Francisco.</li>
                        </ul>
